Python sometimes keeps string literals in memory automatically, even if you didnâ€™t assign them to a variable.

"nikhil" as a text is already an object in Pythonâ€™s internal string pool.
So when you call sys.getrefcount("nikhil"), Python counts:
The internal reference to the cached string "nikhil"
The temporary reference created when passing it to getrefcount()
Possibly another internal reference used by the shell or memory management
Thatâ€™s why you see a reference count of 3 even though you didnâ€™t explicitly create any variable called "nikhil".

ðŸ’¡ Key idea:
Strings and small integers are interned in Python â€” Python keeps them in memory to reuse and save space.
This is why "nikhil" already exists internally.

<!-- ouput of scripts  -->
>>> import sys
>>> sys.getrefcount("nikhil")
3
>>> sys.getrefcount('nikhil')
3
>>> sys.getrefcount(123)
